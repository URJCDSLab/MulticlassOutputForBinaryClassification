# MulticlassOutputForBinaryClassification

This repository contains the R code implementing the After-the-model and In-the-model methods from the paper "**Multiclass Output for Binary Classification Problems**". It also includes the datasets used in the study and the corresponding results.

The repository is organized as follows:

-   The *datasets* folder contains the dataset files.
-   The *Results* folder includes three .qmd files, one for each dataset, presenting the results discussed in the paper.
-   The *GeneralAndMethodFunctions.R* script provides the implementation of the After-the-model and In-the-model algorithms, along with the necessary auxiliary functions.
